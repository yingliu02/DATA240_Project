The raw dataset contains four tables. We merged them into a single table and uploaded it to the Google drive, via link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WDfh8HLYOtUNuhRZqKCScd1qb4l9sqyj/view?usp=sharing

Instruction on how to run your code:

Merge_raw_data.py: this file is used to merge the four tables in the raw dataset based on user id. It was edited in VS Code, and can be run by command line “python3 merge_raw_data.py”.

Classic_ml_models.py: this file is used to train and evaluate the classic machine learning models, such as k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost, on imbalanced training data and balanced training data. It was edited in VS Code, and can be run by command line “python3 classic_ml_models.py”.
